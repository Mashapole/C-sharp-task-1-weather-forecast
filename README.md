the minimum temperature, maximum temperature, precipitation, humidity, and wind
speed per day should be generated and displayed. The lowest minimum temperature, as
well as the highest maximum temperature, precipitation, humidity, and wind speed that
was forecasted within the specified date range should be highlighted.
• Generate a weather forecast report for multiple cities within a specific date range: The
weather forecaster should select all the cities that should be included in the report, as well
as specify the start and end date that the report should be based on. The minimum
temperature, maximum temperature, precipitation, humidity, and wind speed per day, for
each of the selected cities should then be displayed. For each day the lowest minimum

wind speed that was forecasted for the selected cities should also be highlighted.
